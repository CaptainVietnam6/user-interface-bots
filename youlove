I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start
A flame in your heart
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love, love, love, love
And with your admission
That you'd feel the same
I just want to be the one you love, love, love, love
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start
A flame in your heart
