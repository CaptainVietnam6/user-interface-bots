Yeah
Alright, everyone ready?
Let's go
Blackout!
Blackout!
I'm losing all
Losing all of my senses
Yeah I'm giving all
Giving all my affection
Yeah, I'm burning up, burning up but I'm restless
Yeah, I'll never stop, never stop (never stop)
I've had some dark days
(We've had them all)
I'll mix a drink up
(Get back to work)
I've got my boys here
We say it once, say it twice
Say it three times
Go and put the lights out
We'll be fine
We'll keep fighting on and on and on all through the night
Go and put the lights out, it's alright
We'll keep fighting on and on and on and on
Keep going, keep going, keep going until we blackout
Blackout!
All my life I've been searching perfection
Think I've found, think I found a direction
Man get the fuck out if you can't handle rejection, yeah
You're rejected 'cause we race against the clock
Supersonic to the top
Hear my brothers screaming
Keep going, keep going (ay)
Keep going, keep going
Keep going, keep going (ay)
Go and put the lights out
We'll be fine
We'll keep fighting on and on and on all through the night
Go and put the lights out, it's alright
We'll keep fighting on and on and on and on
Keep going, keep going, keep going until we blackout
Alright, this is gonna sound a bit strange, but I need y'all to trust me
To get what you want, you need to keep going, no matter what
So just say after me, ay
Every time it gets tough, will you stop? (No)
Every time it gets rough, will you stop? (No)
Every time you fall down, will you stop?
(No we will never stop until we get a fucking blackout)
Go and put the lights out
We'll be fine
We'll keep fighting on and on and on all through the night
Go and put the lights out, it's alright
We'll keep fighting on and on and on and on
Keep going, keep going, keep going until we blackout
Blackout!
